== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use it with WP Super Cache? =

Yes! You just need to make some adjustments on WP Super Cache's Advanced settings tab.

1. In the Caching section, choose the option labeled **Use PHP to serve cached files.**
2. In the Advanced section, enable the "Mobile Device Support" checkbox.
3. At the bottom of the page, there's a "rejected user agents" section. Add a line that says **'ipad'**Â (lowercase, without quotes). Then click on the **Save UA Strings** button.
4. Delete the cache. You can do this from the admin bar, or the Easy tab on SP Super Cache's settings page.
